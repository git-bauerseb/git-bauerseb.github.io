                    <p>
                        Each year in the US there is a competition called AIME. The competition consists of
                        15 math problems, getting harder from problem to problem. The answers to the problems are in the
                        range 0 to 999. Here, I'll show some of my own solutions to these problems.

                    <h3>Description</h3>

                    <p>
                        Let \(a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R}\). Given the following equations

                        $$
                            a + b = -3 
                        $$
                        $$
                            ab + bc + ca = -4
                        $$
                        $$
                            abc + bcd + cda + dab = 14
                        $$
                        $$
                            abcd = 30
                        $$

                        the sum \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2\) can be written as \(\frac{m}{n}\).
                        Find \(m + n\).
                    </p>

                    <h4>My solution</h4>
                    <p>
                        Before starting, a equation that will often occur in this problem is:

                        $$
                            x + \frac{a}{x} = b \iff
                        $$
                        $$
                            x^2 -bx + a = 0
                        $$
                        which has the solutions:
                        $$
                            x_{1,2} = b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4a}
                        $$

                        What immediately caught my i was that \(d\) is only in the last two equations.
                        So reformat last equation to get

                        $$
                            d = \frac{30}{abc}
                        $$

                        Substituting in third equation yields:

                        $$
                            abc + \frac{30}{a} + \frac{30}{b} + \frac{30}{c} = 14
                        $$
                        $$
                            \iff abc + \frac{30 (bc + ac + ab)}{abc} = 14
                        $$
                        From third equation it follows that
                        $$
                            abc - \frac{4}{abc} = 14
                        $$
                        and thus \(abc \in \{-6, 20\}\). Let's suppose, \(abc = -6\). Then
                        $$
                            c = -\frac{6}{ab}
                        $$
                        Substituting in second equation and rearranging yields:
                        $$
                            ab + c (b + a) = -4
                        $$
                        $$
                            ab + \frac{18}{ab} = -4
                        $$
                        But because of the above observation, it is obvious that this has no
                        real solution. Thus \(abc = 20\) and so by the same reasoning \(c = \frac{20}{ab}\):
                        $$
                            ab - \frac{60}{ab} = -4
                        $$
                        so \(ab \in \{6, -10\}\). If \(ab = 6\) then \(b = \frac{6}{a}\). But then
                        $$
                            a + \frac{6}{a} = -3
                        $$
                        which again has no real solutions. So \(ab = -10\). Now we find that \(c = \frac{20}{ab} = -2\) and
                        by first equation that \(a = 2, b = -5\). So, in the end:
                        $$
                            a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + \left(\frac{30}{abc}\right)^2 =
                        $$
                        $$
                            4 + 25 + 4 + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{141}{4}
                        $$
                        So the answer is \(145\).
                    </p>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                        What this problem really demonstrates is that sometimes you just need to repeat
                        (stupid) things in order to solve a problem. I first thought, this problem turns into a nice
                        factoring or modulus exercise but then I came up with this solution.
